# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
We are using machine learning to evaluate credit card risk

## Results
Looking at the 6 different supervised machine learning models we got:
Balanced Random Forest Classifier 94%
Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifer 93.2%
Naive Random Oversampling 64.6%
Smote Oversampling 64.6%
Cluster Centrolds 64.6%
Combination of over and under using SMOTEENN 54.4%

## Summary
Based on the above results, we can determine the best supervised machine learning model would be Balanced Random Forest Classifer.
